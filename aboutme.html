                    <p>I have lived in the united states since 2011, spent few years in the Bay Area where my dream was to join the tech industry. I really enjoyed being in San Francisco but found out about how beautiful Austin was and came over in 2017, and now I'm in love with this gorgeous city and I see myself spending the rest of my life here.

                    <p>I have so far worked with few tech companies,where I filled different key-roles that allowed to gain a decent knowledge on various softwares.
                        I have worked as a brand ambassador and beta program partner with NEXAR INC assisting them with the testing and developing the software for a smart dashcam system. I then worked with Apple as content review analyst with the POI team (Points Of Interests) for Apple Maps. I later joined the YouTube team after the Apple project as a data analyst/ content review analyst, and my mission was to keep the young users away from any harmful content.
                        I finally ended-up with the WAYMO team developing the self driving technology as a fleet response specialist/ data analyst.
