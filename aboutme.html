        <p>My name is Noureddine Semahi, I was born in April 29th of 1987 in Algeria, I studied Sciences of the Language and Didactics. I am a father of two beautiful little kids, Emma has 5 years old and Aylan has just celebrated his first birthday.
        I have a huge passion for technology ever since i was little kid, I always tried to stay up to date and well informed about the new cutting-edge technologies.

        <p> I have traveled around a little and I have visited few countries in Europe. I speak four languages: berber (my native language), Arabic, French and English and now I am now working on mastering the best language of all times (Code).

        <p>I have so far worked with few tech companies,where I filled different key-roles that allowed to gain a decent knowledge on various softwares.
          I have worked as a brand ambassador and beta program partner with NEXAR INC assisting them with the testing and developing the software for a smart dashcam system. I then worked with Apple as content review analyst with the POI team (Points Of Interests) for Apple Maps. I later joined the YouTube team after the Apple project as a data analyst/ content review analyst, and my mission was to keep the young users away from any harmful content.
          I finally ended-up with the WAYMO team developing the self driving technology as a fleet response specialist/ data analyst.
